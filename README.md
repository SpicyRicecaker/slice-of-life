- If we use static site (we kinda have to)
  - We must then write files from another program
    - Google docs
    - Notepad
  - Problem is that you'll then have to deal with writing dates and other stuff in your editor of choice

Solution: Electron
  - We can have a literal mongodb server running in the backend lol
